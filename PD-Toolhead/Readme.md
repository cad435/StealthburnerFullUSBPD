Update 2024-10-05: I accidentlly left R7 and R8 as series resistance values for the USB-Lines. For another setup, this proves to be too much series resistance. Therefore I replaced it with 0R. If you find yourself to have random disconnects I advice you to increase those values (20R should be enough!)

I found it working with all the Ferrite beads (L1/L4/L5) beeing only ~300R@100Mhz, as well as the common-mode choke beeing just ~600R@100Mhz. <br> <br>

Use two M2 brass inserts on the 2 holes beside the USB-C Connector. <br> <br>

The holes where the "unknurled" shoulder is fitted is 3.1mm in diameter 
Brass inserts I used are sold as "OD=3.5mm, Lenght=3mm". The critical measurement is denoted as "dk" in the picture below.
