You can use the attached V1.2_JLC_PCBA_CPL.xlsx file to directly upload to JLCPCBA. Please keep in mind this is UNTESTED! (I have access to a PCBA-Line, therefore I did not use this) <br> <br>

I found it working with all the Ferrite beads (L1/L4/L5) beeing only ~300R@100Mhz, as well as the common-mode choke beeing just ~600R@100Mhz. <br> <br>

The holes where the "unknurled" shoulder is fitted is 3.1mm in diameter 
Brass inserts I used are sold as "OD=3.5mm, Lenght=3mm". The critical measurement is denoted as "dk" in the picture below.
