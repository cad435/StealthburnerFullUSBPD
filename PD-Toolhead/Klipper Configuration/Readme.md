# Klipper COnfiguration

There a JUST the lines for the hardware pins in the files

For the compile config consider setting PB9 in GPIO pins as this will spin up the fan connected to the bottom fan-connector (usually the fan for the Heatsink!)

## Flashing:

Hold down the "BOOT" button (see Pin Description PDF), than press the RESET Button. The Toolhead will be accessible via ST's USB-Hardware Bootloader in DFU. Use "USB (DFU mode)" option in KIAUH.
